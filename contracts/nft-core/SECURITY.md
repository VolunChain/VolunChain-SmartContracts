# NFT-Core Contract Security Documentation

## Permission Model

The NFT-Core contract implements a role-based permission model with the following roles:

- **Admin**: The account that initialized the contract and has full administrative privileges
- **Authorized Minters**: Accounts explicitly authorized by the admin to mint NFTs
- **NFT Owners**: Accounts that own specific NFTs and can burn them

### Access Control

The contract implements the following access control requirements:

- Only the admin can:
  - Add new authorized minters
  - Pause/unpause the contract
  - Update the contract version
  - Set the base URI for token metadata

- Only authorized minters can:
  - Mint new NFTs
  - Perform batch minting operations

- Only NFT owners can:
  - Burn their own NFTs

## Implemented Protections

### Input Validation

- All input parameters are validated before processing
- Empty or invalid parameters (title, description, etc.) are rejected
- Address parameters are validated to prevent errors
- Batch operations verify consistent data lengths

### Batch Limitations

- Batch operations have maximum size limits to prevent gas-based attacks
- Empty batches are rejected
- Batch data consistency is validated before processing

### Emergency Pause

- The contract can be paused by the admin in case of emergency
- When paused, no new NFTs can be minted or burned
- Read-only operations remain functional during pause

### Storage Management

- The contract implements proper Time-To-Live (TTL) management for storage
- Contract data has appropriate lifetime thresholds
- Methods to extend data lifetime are provided

### Auditability

- All important operations emit events for auditability
- Mint, burn, and admin actions are logged
- State changes are traceable through events

## Best Practices Followed

- **Explicit Authorization**: All sensitive operations require explicit authorization
- **Fail-Fast Principle**: Invalid operations fail early to prevent partial state changes
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Access is restricted to the minimum required level
- **Limit Checks**: Resource usage is limited to prevent abuse
- **Well-Documented Code**: Code includes detailed comments and documentation

## Production Considerations

- **External Audit**: This contract should undergo a professional security audit before production use
- **Gradual Deployment**: Consider a phased deployment approach with limited assets initially
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for suspicious activities
- **Emergency Response Plan**: Have a plan for responding to security incidents
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the contract updated with the latest security practices

## Known Limitations

- The contract does not implement NFT transfer functionality
- Metadata, once set, cannot be updated
- The contract is optimized for non-transferable recognition badges

## Updates and Versions

The contract includes a versioning mechanism that allows for controlled updates. Only the admin can update the contract version, ensuring that updates follow proper governance procedures.
